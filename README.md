It creates three bombers at strategic locations in the core.
Each bomber is divided into two turrets, and each turret takes up three lines of code, that is, three cells in the core.
Thus, the bombers only take up six cells each and can function even after losing one of their turrets. This makes it possible for one of their halves to evade destruction by other bombers.

Additionally, some of the JMP instructions have a second value given to them. This second value does not modify the way the JMP itself works, however it does increment or decrement a cell that is statistically more likely to have important enemy code, thus adding an extra way to screw your enemies over, and also, in a way, sneaking in two instructions into one single line (and thus cell), making it do more in less space.

And just to add more and make myself known as the biggest rat of them all, I added an infinite JMP loop that takes only two cells and you need to kill this fella to win or else it's a draw :)
